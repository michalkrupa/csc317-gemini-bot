# CSC317 Gemini Bot

This repository contains the code for a simple chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API. It's likely part of a course assignment (CSC317).

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Gemini API into a Python application to create a basic conversational bot. You can use it to ask questions and receive responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Prerequisites

*   **Google Cloud Project & Gemini API Key:**
    *   You need a Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled.
    *   Obtain an API key for accessing the Gemini API.  **Remember to keep your API key secure!**

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/michalkrupa/csc317-gemini-bot.git
    cd csc317-gemini-bot
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js (if not already installed):**
    *   **Check if Node.js is installed:**
        ```bash
        node -v
        ```
        If you see a version number, Node.js is installed. Skip to step 3.  If you see an error, follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system below:

    *   **Linux (using nvm - recommended):**
        ```bash
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
        source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
        nvm install --lts  # Installs the latest LTS version
        nvm use --lts
        ```
        **Important:**  Close and reopen your terminal after installing nvm, or source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file for the changes to take effect:  `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

    *   **macOS (using Homebrew - recommended):**
        ```bash
        brew install node
        ```

    *   **Windows (using Chocolatey - recommended):**
        ```powershell
        # Run as administrator
        choco install nodejs
        ```
        (Or download the installer directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))

    *   **Generic (Download Installer):**
        Go to the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

3.  **Install npm dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Set your Gemini API key:**  There's likely a place in the code (e.g., a `.env` file or directly in the script) where you need to input your API key.  **Do not commit your API key to the repository!**  A common practice is to use an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    Or create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

    And then load it in the Python script:

    ```python
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()

    api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
    ```

2.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python main.py  # Or the name of the main script
    ```

    The bot should start running and you can interact with it through the command line.
